/*
* $breakpoint:
* - phone 320-767 px
* - tab-port 768-1023 px
* - tab-land 1024-1365 px
* - desktop min-width: 1366+ px AND min-height: 720px
*
* To use the device mixin for media query:
* At the top of the component scss file, add:
* @use "<path to the this scss file without _>" as m;
* eg: @use '../../styles/mixins' as m;
*
* Then to use it, simply put:
* m is the namespace of the mixins file from the @use statement
* @include m.device(phone) {     // argument can be phone, tabport, tabland, or desktop
*   ...css
* }
*
* Real example can refer to .container inside _layout.scss file
*
* !IMPORTANT: the breakpoint system is based on mobile first approach.
*             So component should be styles for phone first then move up to larger devices
